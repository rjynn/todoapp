todoapp
=======

This application is a simple list app. It displays a list which a user can add items to display. These items can be deleted, checked/unchecked and hidden from view by sending it to an archives list.

Usage
=========
To Add Item: Type out the item you want to add in the textbox provided then click Add. You should see the item on the bottom of the list.

To view archived items, statistics or select multiple items click the settings button on the top right corner and click the menu item desired.

To delete, email or archive a single item in the active list, click and hold the single item for a popup menu and click desired menu item.

In multiple selections, clicking on the checkbox will do nothing, but clicking on the item will select the item for emailing. Or you may click the 'Select All' button to select all the items for emailing.
